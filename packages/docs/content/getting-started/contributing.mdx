Thanks for showing interest to contribute to @congenial-spoon/cdk ðŸ’–, you rock!

When it comes to open source, there are different ways you can contribute, all
of which are valuable. Here's a few guidelines that should help you as you
prepare your contribution.

## Setup the Project

Setting up the docsite project is easy. It's a Next JS site. The following steps
will get you up and running to contribute to the @congenial-spoon/cdk docsite:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of
   [this page](https://github.com/congenial-spoon/cdk))

2. Clone your fork locally

```sh
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/cdk.git
cd cdk
```

3. Setup all the dependencies and packages by running `pnpm`.

4. Execute `pnpm dev` to spin up a local development server. If you're running
   Windows, contentlayer might not work as expected, so you'd need to do
   `npx contentlayer build` before running `pnpm dev` in order to generate the
   docsite content.

> If you run into any issues, kindly reach out to the @congenial-spoon/cdk React team here:

### Commands

**`pnpm`**: installs the dependency packages.

**`pnpm dev`**: starts the local development server.

**`pnpm build`**: builds the docsite for production.

**`pnpm lint`**: runs the nextjs linter which checks for code issues.

### Commit Convention

Before you create a Pull Request, please check whether your commits comply with
the commit conventions used in this repository.

When you create a commit we kindly ask you to follow the convention
`category(scope or module): message` in your commit message while using one of
the following categories:

- `feat`: all changes that introduce completely new code or new features
- `fix`: changes that fix a bug (ideally you will additionally reference an
  issue if present)
- `refactor`: any code related change that is not a fix nor a feature
- `docs`: changing existing or creating new documentation (i.e. README, docs for
  usage of a lib or cli usage)
- `build`: all changes regarding the build of the software, changes to
  dependencies or the addition of new dependencies
- `ci`: all changes regarding the configuration of continuous integration (i.e.
  github actions, ci system)
- `chore`: all changes to the repository that do not fit into any of the above
  categories

If you are interested in the detailed specification you can visit
https://www.conventionalcommits.org/ or check out the
[Angular Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-guidelines).

### Steps to PR

1. Fork of the chakra-ui-docs repository and clone your fork

2. Create a new branch out of the `main` branch. We follow the convention
   `[type/scope]`. For example `fix/accordion-hook` or `docs/menu-typo`. `type`
   can be either `docs`, `fix`, `feat`, `build`, or any other conventional
   commit type. `scope` is just a short id that describes the scope of work.

3. Make and commit your changes following the
   [commit convention](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui-docs/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-convention).
   As you develop, you can run `pnpm lint` to make sure everything works as
   expected. Please note that you might have to run `pnpm` first in order to
   install all dependencies.
